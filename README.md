# WhyXAMLMustBeFailed
Criticize Microsoft's XAML .

1.low response speed.
	(1) dev tools slow.
	(2) application slow,like SliverLight,WPF,UWP
2.poor stability.
The official Microsoft Windows application is very unstable. It often crashes for several years, or the application cannot be used, the layout is abnormal, and the input is abnormal.
just look at the Microsoft's Official application.
For example, the Windows Store. Its stability and user experience are just like shit, and it lasts for several years without any significant improvement.
3.The xaml label character is very long. The redundancy is very high.
This directly leads to very poor readability.
In addition to the problem of the label itself. The style declaration has the same problem. When this grammar is compared with html and css, you will find that the XAML defined by Microsoft is simply rubbish.
Redundant tags and attributes, redundant styles, this not only increases the cost of writing, but also sacrifices readability. And increase the size of the ui definition file.
