# WhyXAMLMustBeFailed
Criticize Microsoft's XAML .

## low response speed.
1. dev tools slow.
2. application slow,like SliverLight,WPF,UWP
	
## poor stability.
The official Microsoft Windows application is very unstable. 
For example, the Windows Store. Its stability and user experience are just like shit, and it lasts for several years without any significant improvement.
1. often crashes.
2. Unable to start.
3. cannot be used.
4. ayout is abnormal.
5. input is abnormal.
6. No results for the search.
7. The installation failed halfway through.
8. Application White screen.



## XAML itself is very badly designed.The style declaration has the same problem. When this grammar is compared with html and css, you will find that the XAML defined by Microsoft is simply rubbish.
1. The xaml label character is very long.
2. The redundancy is very high.Both tags and attributes.
3. This directly leads to very poor readability.and increases the cost of writing.
4. Increase the size of the ui definition file.
5. Many xmlns. It's very confusing.


In conclusion, XAML has been around for more than ten years.
The problems I have listed have almost always existed, but XAML has not been significantly improved.
XAML technology is applied to WPF, SliverLight, UWP, WinUI, MAUI, etc.
But I think that due to its own flaws, it will be destined to be unpopular.
And it will eventually fail.
